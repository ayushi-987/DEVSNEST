I am learning Front-end........
The projects are maintained in a "**Day-Wise**" manner, according to the Take-Home-Assignments given post each session. Hence, the level of the projects would also be ascending- Beginner to Advance Level.
You can take an idea for the projects to practice from here & start your FrontEnd journey as well!😃
